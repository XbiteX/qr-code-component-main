### What I learned

i learned to import a font that i have locally in a folder
i learned some text features like the weight (that i didn' know what it means) and fallback fonts 
i learned one more time how to center a div

i'm pretty prud of this section of the stylesheet:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Outfit'; 
    src: url('./fonts/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
}
```
